# Ethical-Hacking-Learn-The-Art-of-Hacking-Using-Python3
Learn to hack windows OS using Backdoor and Ransomware created from scratch using Python. Completely for Beginners!
Welcome to this most exciting course on Ethical Hacking: Learn The Art of Hacking Using Python3. Hacking is not always a rewarding activity but it is one of the most fun profession where you can use your knowledge to make yours and others system secured. 

This course will try to turn you into a person who can check for the vulnerability in the system and make your own payload to pen-test that system and evaluate proper security measures that needs to be adopted. We'll try to make payloads and test systems from section one, Thus this course is highly practical. We (Bit4Stack Tech Inc.) assumes that you have no prior knowledge in these topics, So we will provide some theory related to networking at the beginning and hands on examples with it. 

We will cover three modules in this course. Every module will have rich contents related to Hacking. Firstly, we start by creating Backdoor which will provide access to entire file system of victim computer. Then, we use same backdoor to upload the Ransomware that we create from scratch. We will also learn how to bind our payload with other files along with spoofing the file extension.

Things you will learn at this Course:

1. Python subprocess module: How to execute commands in the shell (like upload, download files, Lock Computer)

2. Socket programming: How to make two computer system communicate with each other.

3. Cryptography: Use concept of encryption and decryption to create CryptoLocker ransomware

4. Payload Delivery: How to make virus/malware that we create less suspicious and deliver to Victim's computer
